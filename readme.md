#What is this?

The Ultimate Claws Mail theme is a theme for Claws Mail with icons from the Ultimate Gnome theme for Gnome.
News
Version 0.5.1 is out!

This version adds a couple icons, notably the attach icon.

#Issues

    Incomplete Set - not all icons are present. Most common ones are, however. The theme is in development.
    PNG support - This theme is PNG, which requires Claws Mail >= 3.4.0
    Duplicates - I only have the icons from the set, so there are some duplicates where I used the closest available icon.

#Installation

From the official themes page:

    Untar the package.
    Start Claws Mail.
    Go to /Configuration/Preferences.../Display/Themes
    Click the 'Install new' button and locate the theme directory.
    Click 'OK'

Alternately they can be installed by root by untarring the package directly into $PREFIX/share/claws-mail/themes/ They will then be available to every user.
Configuration

    Start Claws Mail.
    Go to /Configuration/Preferences.../Display/Themes
    Select the required theme from the drop-down list.
    Click the 'Use this' button
